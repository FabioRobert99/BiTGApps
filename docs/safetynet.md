# Safetynet Patch Installation Instructions

BiTGApps does contain safetynet patches for passing CTS profile. Installation of Safetynet Patch is not enabled by default. For that you need **cts-config.prop** file.
When this config file not present in device, at the time of installation you will be notified with following texts.

```! CTS config not found```

```! Skip installing CTS patch```

Build property from `system` and `vendor` patched for passing **basic integrity**.

Patched keystore used for passing **CTS profile**.

## Android Version Support

* 8.0.0 and above

## OS Patch Level

* Security Patch Level

Some devices need same SPL in `system`, `vendor` and `boot`. If found mismatching then device refuse to boot into system.
On technical side, **Keymaster HAL** crashing becuase of different SPL in `boot` then `system` and `vendor`.
The Keymaster trusted app in TrustZone refuses to work if `system`, `vendor` and `boot` SPLs don't match. It's part of anti-rollback protection.

To fix this issue, BiTGApps will update boot image SPL at the time of installation.

## Boot Conflicts

Failure of patched keystore can cause bootloop.

## Installation Conflicts

Installation of safetynet patch entirely depends on boot image editing. For any reason, BiTGApps installer failed to extract/unpack/edit boot image, safetynet patch will not be installed and you will be notified with following texts and
installation will exit. At this point all you have to do is, delete config file, reboot to recovery and install BiTGApps.

```! Error installing CTS patch```

No changes will made in **system/vendor** regarding safetynet patch.

## Restore Conflicts

OTA survival script can't restore safetynet patch. The way function executes will override the modified boot image.

Below is an example of function from updater-script:

* `run_program("backuptool.sh", "restore", "/dev/block/system", "ext4");`

* `package_extract_file("boot.img", "/dev/block/boot");`

Restore function from OTA script triggers before installation of stock boot image. So anything done at **restore stage** will be override by next function.

If we switch functions (Should be implemented in ROM):

* `package_extract_file("boot.img", "/dev/block/boot");`

* `run_program("backuptool.sh", "restore", "/dev/block/system", "ext4");`

Then we will able to restore full safetynet patch. Since this type of functionality is not available, you will need to re-install BiTGApps after installing OTA update.

_**Note:** This is the only exception with safetynet patch and does not affect rest of the OTA survival script functionality. OTA survival script can restore anything but not full safetynet patch._
