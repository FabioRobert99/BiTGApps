# ROMs With GApps Installation Instructions

BiTGApps can be installed in ROMs shipped with GApps. No config is required for this. Installer will detect supported ROMs and execute required functions itself.

**Supported ROMS:**

* Pixel Experience
* Paranoid Android
* Evolution X

We are removing all pre-installed Google Apps from supported ROMs. So we need stock APKs as a replacement to google ones. Below is the list of APKs given.
- Contacts
- Dialer
- Messages
- ManagedProvisioning
- Provision

**Note:** Both Provision packages are replacement of Google's SetupWizard.

## Usage

Installation of BiTGApps in such ROMs can be done, before or after booting into system.

## OTA

During OTA update, BiTGApps OTA survival script will remove all pre-install google apps and restore BiTGApps components back in system.
